Tanzania has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. It is also home to beautiful landscapes and great lakes. Even with it's promising economic state, only around 50% of the population have access to clean water. Most of the water basins are being polluted at alarming rates due to industrious process and improper handling of waste. With this pollution combined with the semi-arid environment of the country, there is a crisis due to the lack of access to clean water which causes many people to rely on contaminated supplies which puts many peoples' lives at great risk.

To battle the water crisis, many waterpoints have been set up across the country. Many of these waterpoints have water pumps which allows even those living in rural areas access to clean water. While these pumps have given many people access to clean water, many of the pumps are in need of repair and some are even non-functional. An agency was charged with recording data for these waterpoints and Tarifaa has set up a competition to promote using data science to help determine which pumps are functional, functional but in need of repair and non-functional. Through the use of predictive modeling, information about a pump could be used to determine the operating status of a pump. Important information about how to improve waterpoints could also be gathered from this process. In project three, I attempted the challenge presented by Tarifaa.

Using a training set of data that was provided, I was to build a model that could predict the functionality status of a water pump. I first cleaned and examined the data. The image above shows a heat map of the pumps in the training data set. The points in dark blue are non-functional pumps, turquoise - pumps that need repair and teal are the pumps that are fully functional.

Using techniques learned in Module 3, I constructed a model using the provided training set data and then applied the model to a provided test set of data which I could then submit to the website hosting the competition. My model was able to determine 78.42% of the data correctly  as shown below:

I may continue to attempt to improve my score, it felt like a short week to build an optimal model for this project. Combined with the recent pandemic call for Covid-19 by the World Health Organization, it was a trying week. Nevertheless I enjoyed pushing my newfound data science abilities to the test and hope there is more I can do for those struggling in the world such as those with no clean water in Tanzania as I continue to learn and master the art of Data Science.

Thanks for reading!
