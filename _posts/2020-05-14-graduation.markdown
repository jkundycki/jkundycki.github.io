I had originally planned on attending the course on-campus but due to logistics, opted to study online instead. I have to say I have no regrets in that decision. I had not taken online courses before and it was intriguing to see how technology has contributed to a seamless transition from classroom to bedroom. I would bet that online learning will become the norm for many students especially after the current pandemic. FlatIron's teaching model appealed to me because it was focused on learning and not on achieving a good GPA. It also was very program specific without forcing students to take courses (and pay hefty fees for those courses) that were not pertinent to future career paths.

As I turn in the final parts of my capstone project, I'm finding myself at the finish line of my education at FlatIron and it is bittersweet. I never thought that I'd return to being a student again, and it was great being able to pace and manage my time learning new skills. I'm certainly going to miss it. Obviously, I learned many new skills through the program but I almost met great personalities too. I hope for the best to those other students of my cohort.  I have faith that the program has prepared us for a career in Data Science. I am both anxious and excited too see what the future brings.

Best of luck to you,

John
