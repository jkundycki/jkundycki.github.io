This post marks the end of my second week of a declared job search with FlatIron School. Following my last blog, I began networking as was mandated by the program to get a tuition refund. I haven't had any success yet at landing an interview but perhaps that will change. Based on my results of networking from the first week, I'm already sold. Most of my contacts from networking in the first week were FlatIron alumni working at prospective employers. 4 out of 6 of the contacts replied to me and I was able to communicate over the phone with 2 of them which was very nice. They imparted good advice which may lead me to moving my blog posts to Medium.com amongst other things. Also advised was some minor updates to my LinkedIn profile which I think will help and also what programs I could be working on. 3 out of the 4 responders were eager to give me a referral at their company after talking with me, which is already better a better result than I've had just hammering out resumes everywhere and anywhere. I hope something fruitful comes of these interactions and I'm excited to continue networking to see if it bears any results.

My plan for week three is to continue networking as I have with mostly FlatIron alumni. The areas I'm going to focus on are both my blogposts and current projects. I've been working on a time series prediction project but I need to extend or perhaps change projects altogether to include some new software such as Tableau which will be a great addition on my resume. Improving my project work will go hand-in-hand with the improvement of blog posts. After reviewing several articles on Medium, I definitely have room to improve my game. Also, as advised by a contact, moving to Medium will probably get more exposure to my blogposts. If I'm able to buckle down and improve on these fronts, I'm sure it will ensure future success at landing a first job in a new field.

To whoever reads this (if anyone), best of luck and once again feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn (my name is John Kundycki) if you want to connect, discuss strategy or have any questions.

Cheers,

John
