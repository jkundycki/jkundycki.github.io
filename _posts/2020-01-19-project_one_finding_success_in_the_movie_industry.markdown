Over a month ago, I took a leap of faith and left my job to study Data Science full time. The lessons were difficult and at times grueling, but as a cohort, we had finally made it through Module 1. It was time to put our new-found skills to the test.
Our first project was a hypothetical scenario in which Microsoft wanted to get into the movie industry and hired me to sort through large amounts of box office data so that I could provide them with insights on how to find success in the industry.

The Project was daunting and challenging. I had no confidence in my coding or skills as a data scientist. I started by grouping my data by the highest gross profit and highest gross profit margin movies, because I thought that would be most important to a business. Take a look at the graphs I made:

I then, decided to look at the top 50 for both categories. I tried to make visualizations but they weren't easy on the eye, so I kept my initial ones of 25. Funny enough, the top profit margin movie of all time was the movie Deep Throat but I removed it because it was such an outlier that it detracted from the other movies.

A trend that jumped out at me was that Top Profit movies tended to be sequels, prequels, remakes or belong to an already established franchise (Avengers standalones, Pixar movies...). Top Profit Margin movies tended to be original, new concepts.

I wanted to find out more about Top Profit Margin movies because I thought it would be interesting to investigate how we could increase our odds of an original idea being a success. I decided to start my search by seeing which genres were most represented. A lot of the movies in our dataset were missing genre information, but I made due with what I had and sorted for any hits I could get out of the top 500 profit margin movies:

Pretty neat, right?

I continued my investigation by seeing if the release months for top profit margin movies of a particular genre differed from the release months of all movies for that genre (a little convotued, I know). Here's a snippet of what the data looked like for the genre of Horror:

I nodded my head as I saw that most of the top profit margin releases for Horror were in October but was shocked to find out that most releases were not.

As I finish this blog post for the second time (first time, something strange happened and everything vanished), I am concluding this project as this is the last part of the project I have left. I now look back and snicker at the "You should expect this project to take between 20 and 25 hours of solid, focused effort...". Yeah right, try more like 50+ hours...
That being said I had a genuine appreciation for the project: I thought the topic and findings were interesting. Most important of all, I leave the project with some sense of pride and confidence in my young, developing data science skillset.

If something in life is challenging you, I encourage you to push through and stay focused. I want to share this feeling of accomplishment with you.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post and best of luck!
