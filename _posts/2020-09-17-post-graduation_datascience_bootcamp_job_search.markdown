With my job search declared, I am off on the journey of landing a first job in field of Data Science. The timing isn't the best because of the current pandemic, but businesses seem to be opening more and more positions every day. Before declaring the job search with FlatIron, I thought I would dip my toes into the application pool. I had taken more of a passive approach, hammering many applications every day. So far, this strategy has not worked out in my favor; I have yet to have the opportunity to interview. From here on out, I will try a more active approach. What does that mean? It means attempting to network through the use of social media. To add to this, I've been studying here and there to stay up-to-date on my newly acquired skills but I will try and be more dilligent and focused.

For those reading this who might be in my situation or who will eventually be in my situation, I will impart my preliminary knowledge which you might find helpful during your job search. First, a trend I've noticed for job titles is that the majority of job titles that seem pertinent to a graduate of the Datascience program seem to be:

-Data Scientist
-Data Analyst
-Business Analyst
-Machine Learning Engineer
-Data Engineer
-Consultant (this one is vague)

There are variations to these, but these seem to be the meat of the position titles to which the skills acquired during the Bootcamp match up to. Speaking of skills, in addition to practicing those learned during the program, I am working on acquiring new ones which might improve success of landing a job and making myself a more well rounded Data Scientist.

Data Science skills that were not taught during the program but seem to be the most in-demand on the job listings are the following:

-R
-SAS
-AWS
-Tableau
-Hadoop

If you can work on these skills or incorporate them into your capstone project, it will certainly give you an edge among your peers.

That about wraps up my quick summary of trends I've noticed during my preliminary job search. If you have any questions or would like to discuss strategy or just talk, feel free to reach out and connect with me through LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kundycki-97000a11a/. Now, back to my journey where I will continue to sift through the ocean of Entry Level positions requiring 5+ years of work experience in the field. Jokes aside, we will see where my new strategies take me.

Until next time,

John
